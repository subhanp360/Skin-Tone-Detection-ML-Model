# Skin Tone Detection ML Model

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model for detecting and classifying skin tones. The model categorizes images into three skin tone categories: Black, Brown, and White.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model was sourced from Kaggle and categorized into Black, Brown, and White skin tones. Due to its size, the dataset is hosted separately.
